# Music-Genre-Classifier
Using Deep Learning, Librosa and GTZAN Music Genre Dataset  to classify music genres
Project Title: Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning
Objective:
To build a deep learning model that can classify music tracks into different genres using the GTZAN dataset.

Dataset:
The GTZAN dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, with 100 tracks per genre.

Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Load the GTZAN dataset.
Extract features from audio files (e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, etc.).
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Building:

Build a deep learning model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
Define the architecture of the model with appropriate layers such as convolutional, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
Compile the model with suitable loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
Model Training:

Train the model on the training set.
Use the validation set for monitoring the performance and preventing overfitting.
Experiment with hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the test set.
Calculate accuracy and other relevant metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the performance metrics using plots or confusion matrices.
Model Fine-tuning (Optional):

Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or modifying the architecture.
Utilize techniques like data augmentation or regularization to improve generalization.
Deployment (Optional):

Deploy the trained model for real-world applications using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or Flask.
Develop a user interface for users to interact with the deployed model.
Tools and Technologies:
Python
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for building and training the deep learning model)
Librosa (for audio processing)
Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing and evaluation)
Matplotlib or Seaborn (for data visualization)
Flask or TensorFlow Serving (for model deployment)
Conclusion:
This project aims to demonstrate the application of deep learning in music genre classification using the GTZAN dataset. By following the outlined steps, one can build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying music tracks into different genres. Additionally, the model can be further improved through experimentation with various architectures and hyperparameters.
